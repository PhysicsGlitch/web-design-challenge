Web Design Challenge

This website draws some visualizations form our first group project as well as resources gathered around the web to create an info center for Covid-19 resources.
The website has a home page and then resources the explore the covid numbers as well as potential political implications. A partial list of the data used is replicated in a resources page,
although the full information is too comprehensive to visually display.

Additionally, in terms of credit images were drawn from the Covid project I did with my group for the previous work assignment. I also expanded on other parts of the data with my own researh
and analysis. 

In terms of website functionality, a nav bar and dropdown list displays the homepage and then a dropdown links to the other pages. I highlighted the visualization comparison page
for emphasis and to display a slightly different functionality. Containers and jumbotrons contain most of the data. Buttons with links on the home page with thumbnails were also
added for increased visual appeal.
